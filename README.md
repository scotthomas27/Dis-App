# Dissapearing-Text-Writing-App
A simple desktop application inspired by "The Most dangerous Writing App". If you stop typing the text will disappear.

NOTE: The text is still written to the local save file, `doc.txt`, even after it disappears from the app interface.

Some changes have been made in this fork:

- The input box has been significantly increased in size.

- The verbose in-app instructions have been removed (it's pretty self explanatory).

- The input text colours and size have been modified to better suit old eyes. ;)
