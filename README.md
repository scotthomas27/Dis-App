# Dissapearing-Text-Writing-App
A simple desktop application inspired by "The Most dangerous Writing App". If you stop typing the text will disappear.

Some changes have been made in this fork:
. The input box has been significantly increased in size.
. The full suite of on-page instructions has been removed (the app is pretty self explanatory)
. The input text colours and size have been modified to better suit old eyes. ;)

## Installation instructions
